Purpose
=======

The purpose of this document is to capture ideas we wish to implement in LMS that are important enough to be captured, but not high enough in priority to live in JIRA.

* Before adding an idea here, see if it already exists in JIRA.
* Comment on an idea by commenting on its PR, or by creating a new PR.
* If an idea is added to JIRA, move the title to `Ticketed Ideas`_ along with the ticket ID.
* Move ideas to the `Rejected Ideas`_ list if they are rejected for any reason, and provide a reason.

Note: This document is itself an experiment.
